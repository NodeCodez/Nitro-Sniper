2) Then click on 'console' at the top of the screen

4) Enter the following code into that area:

var req=webpackJsonp.push([[],{extra_id:(e,r,t)=>e.exports=t},[["extra_id"]]]);for(let e in req.c)if(req.c.hasOwnProperty(e)){let r=req.c[e].exports;if(r&&r.__esModule&&r.default)for(let e in r.default)"getToken"===e&&console.log(r.default.getToken())}

**COMMON PROBLEMS**

- Why is my Nitro Sniper closing when I open it?
You have entered your token incorrectly, please refer back to the video.


**HOW DOES IT WORK?**

It detects discord.gift | discord.com/gifts | discordapp.com/gifts links and it redeems it to your account, it's extremely easy to understand.


**HOW TO USE?**

[BROKEN]
You can use our Server Joiner but BEWARE you may be banned for using this, we have a 10 minute delay per server but it doesn't mean you can't get banned.

Join as many servers as you possibly can. We have left links to where you can find discords in the downloads area. We recommend joining nitro drop discords or emote servers as they have the highest chance of nitros being sent. Once you've joined discords open up your nitro sniper and leave it over night or whilst you are at school, make sure you do not click in the cmd randomly or click any keys as it may pause the console and stop working. Do not turn off your computer!
